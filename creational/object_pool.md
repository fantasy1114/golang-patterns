# Object Pool Pattern

The [object pool design pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_pool_pattern) allows multiple instances to be kept in a collection ("pool") in order to have already been initialized when other instances are ready to use them.

# Implementation and Example

An example with implementation and usage can be found in [object_pool.go](object_pool.go).
